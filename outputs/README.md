# Outputs Folder

This folder stores results, plots, and figures generated by the optimization algorithms.
1. Pareto Front (pareto_front.png)

Shows the Pareto-optimal solutions representing the trade-off between maximizing throughput and minimizing defects. No solution improves one objective without worsening the other.

2. Weighted Sum Method (weighted_sum_isolines.png)

Displays solutions obtained using different weight combinations for objectives. The results depend on weight selection and capture only part of the Pareto front.

3. Epsilon-Constraint Method (epsilon_constraint.png)

Shows solutions generated by constraining one objective while optimizing the other. This method explores the Pareto front more systematically.

4. Knee Point Analysis (knee_point.png)

Identifies the knee point on the Pareto front, representing the most balanced solution between throughput and defect minimization.
